# Tests

## Functional test

A list of demo websites that can be used for testing can be found [here](https://github.com/herrjemand/awesome-webauthn#demos).
Remember that U2F is only a subpart of WebAuthn.
A great one is https://webauthn.me/. And especially its [debugger](https://webauthn.me/debugger) mode.


## Speculos functional test

Some functional tests are located in `tests/speculos/` directory.
They are using the Python client of [Speculos](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/speculos) to run the tests directly on the Speculos emulator.

See dedicated `README.md` in `tests/speculos` directory for how to launch them.
